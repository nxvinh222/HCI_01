			"If we listened to our intellect we'd never have a love affair. We'd never have a friendship. We'd never go in business because we'd be cynical: \"It's gonna go wrong.\" Or \"She's going to hurt me.\" Or,\"I've had a couple of bad love affairs, so therefore . . .\" Well, that's nonsense. You're going to miss life. You've got to jump off the cliff all the time and build your wings on the way down.",

		quote:
			"To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow, Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,To the last syllable of recorded time; And all our yesterdays have lighted fools The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle! Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player, That struts and frets his hour upon the stage, And then is heard no more. It is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.",
